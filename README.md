# Human-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Me and my team implemented two machine learning algorithms to ease the process of patients' diagnosis by predicting diseases based on recognizable symptoms. Machine learning methods can be smartly used to improve patient and health care. The model has a user-friendly interface that is easy to use for patients. The output is fairly accurate to give patients an idea of the kind of diseases that they may be affected with. This project was a part of the curriculum associated with a Machine Learning course.
